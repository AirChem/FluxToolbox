Change Log for FluxToolBox.



20131008 GMW

 - Cosmetic changes to detrend.m
 - ogive.m modified to use absolute value of spectral power, thus giving a reasonable ogive shape for cases where a cospectrum contains both positive and negative spectral power.
 - allSpectra.m modified to also output log-binned spectra and cospectra in a substructure (Sp.bin).
 - Added function, sensHeat.m, to convert heat flux from K m/s to W/m^2.
 - Added function f53line.m, to plot line with -5/3 slope alongside frequency spectra.
